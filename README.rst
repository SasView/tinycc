TinyCC compiler bundle
======================

TinyCC (or tcc) is a small, fast C compiler capable of producing DLLs that can
be loaded via ctypes.  This version compiles for 64 bit Windows.

Compiler version: 0.9.26 (amd64) 2013-02-16

Installation of the compiler and the python interface is simply::

    pip install tinycc

Full documentation for the compiler is available at `<http://bellard.org/tcc>`_.
Source and binaries are available from `<https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tinycc/>`_.

*TCC* is the full path to the tcc.exe executable, wrapped in quotes so that
it can be used as part of an os.system command even when it contains spaces.
The function *find_tcc_path()* returns the path without quotes.

Usage example::

    import os
    from tinycc import TCC

    COMPILE = TCC + " -shared -rdynamic -Wall %(source)s -o %(target)s"

    source = "hello.c"
    target = os.path.splitext(source)[0] + ".dll"  # replace .c with .dll
    command = COMPILE%{"source": source, "target": target}
    status = os.system(command)
    if status != 0 or not os.path.exists(target):
        raise RuntimeError("compile failed.  File is in %r"%source)

or more simply, use *compile*::

    from tinycc import compile
    dll_path = compile("hello.c")

Use *data_files* to gather the data files required for bundling tinycc
in a py2exe package.  This places the compiler in the tinycc-data directory
beside the library.zip generated by py2exe.  The following should appear in
the setup.py for the py2exe build::

    import tinycc

    data_files = []
    ...
    data_files.extend(tinycc.data_files())
    ...
    setup(
        ...
        data_files = data_files,
        ...
        )
